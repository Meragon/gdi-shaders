# gdi-shaders

C# windows forms GDI+ GLSL shaders.

Most code was taken from https://www.shadertoy.com . Unfortunately I did not save the links.
If someone want to contribute, especially original links for shaders with their licenses, you are welcome then.
For now it's only for educational purposes.
